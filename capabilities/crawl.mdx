### Firecrawl URL Traversal and Content Compilation

Firecrawl performs the following steps:

1. **URL Analysis:** Starts with a given URL, checking for links or using the sitemap.
2. **Recursive Traversal:** Follows each link recursively to discover all subpages.
3. **Content Scraping:** Extracts content from each visited page.
4. **Result Compilation:** Compiles and returns a list of URLs and their corresponding content.

This process ensures a thorough exploration and data extraction from any given website starting from a single URL.
