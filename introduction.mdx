## Welcome to Firecrawl

[Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean markdown for each. No sitemap required.

## How to use it?

We provide an easy to use API with our hosted version. You can find the playground and documentation [here](https://firecrawl.dev/playground). You can also self host the backend if you'd like.

### API Key

To use the API, you need to sign up on [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) and get an API key.

### Crawling

Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v0/crawl \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://mendable.ai"
    }'
```

Returns a jobId

```json
{ "jobId": "1234-5678-9101" }
```

### Check Crawl Job

Used to check the status of a crawl job and get its result.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.firecrawl.dev/v0/crawl/status/1234-5678-9101 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "current": 22,
  "total": 22,
  "data": [
    {
      "content": "Raw Content ",
      "markdown": "# Markdown Content",
      "provider": "web-scraper",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Mendable | AI for CX and Sales",
        "description": "AI for CX and Sales",
        "language": null,
        "sourceURL": "https://www.mendable.ai/"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using Python SDK

### Installing Python SDK

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

### Crawl a website

```python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

crawl_result = app.crawl_url('mendable.ai', {'crawlerOptions': {'excludes': ['blog/*']}})

# Get the markdown
for result in crawl_result:
    print(result['markdown'])
```

### Scraping a URL

To scrape a single URL, use the `scrape_url` method. It takes the URL as a parameter and returns the scraped data as a dictionary.

```python
url = 'https://example.com'
scraped_data = app.scrape_url(url)
```
