### Using Mendable with LLMS to Extract Data from a Scraped Page

Mendable leverages Large Language Models (LLMS) to efficiently extract structured data from web pages. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Define the URL to scrape and the desired data schema using JSON Schema (following OpenAI tool schema).**
   This schema specifies the data structure you expect to extract from the page.

2. **Pass the URL and the schema to the scrape endpoint.**
   Documentation for this endpoint can be found here:
   [Scrape Endpoint Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/scrape)

3. **Receive the scraped data in the structured format defined by your schema.**
   You can then use this data as needed in your application or for further processing.

This method provides a streamlined approach to data extraction, minimizing the need for manual data handling and increasing the accuracy and efficiency of data retrieval.
