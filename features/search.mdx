## Searching the web and scraping the results with Firecrawl

Firecrawl integrates its SERP (Search Engine Results Page) API with its robust scraping infrastructure to provide a seamless search and scrape functionality through a single endpoint. Here's why:

1. **Unified Search Query:**
   Users submit a search query via the SERP endpoint.

2. **Automated Result Scraping:**
   Firecrawl automatically processes the search results and utilizes its scraping capabilities to extract data from each result page.

3. **Data Delivery:**
   The scraped data from all result pages is compiled and delivered in a clean markdown - ready to use.

This integration allows users to efficiently perform web searches and obtain comprehensive, scraped data from multiple sources with minimal effort.

For more details, refer to the [Search Endpoint Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/search).

## Search any query

### /search endpoint

Used to search the web, get the most relevant results, scrape each page and return the markdown.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v0/search \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "query": "firecrawl",
      "pageOptions": {
        "fetchPageContent": true // false for a fast serp api
      }
    }'
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "url": "https://mendable.ai",
      "markdown": "# Markdown Content",
      "provider": "web-scraper",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Mendable | AI for CX and Sales",
        "description": "AI for CX and Sales",
        "language": null,
        "sourceURL": "https://www.mendable.ai/"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

func main() {
  app, err := firecrawl.NewFirecrawlApp("YOUR_API_KEY")
  if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("Failed to initialize FirecrawlApp: %v", err)
  }

  query := "What is firecrawl?"
