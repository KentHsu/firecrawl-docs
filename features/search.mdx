### FireCrawl SERP and Scraping Integration

FireCrawl uniquely integrates its SERP (Search Engine Results Page) API with its robust scraping infrastructure to provide a seamless search and scrape functionality through a single endpoint. Here's how it works:

1. **Unified Search Query:** Users submit a search query via the SERP endpoint.
2. **Automated Result Scraping:** FireCrawl automatically processes the search results and utilizes its scraping capabilities to extract data from each result page.
3. **Data Delivery:** The scraped data from all result pages is compiled and delivered in a structured format, ready for use.

This integration allows users to efficiently perform web searches and obtain comprehensive, scraped data from multiple sources with minimal effort.

For more details on using this feature, refer to the [Search Endpoint Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/search).
