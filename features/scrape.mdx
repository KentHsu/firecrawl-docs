## Scraping with Firecrawl

Firecrawl converts web pages into markdown, ideal for LLM applications. Here's why:

1. **Complexities Managed:**
   Handles proxies, caching, rate limits, and JavaScript-blocked content for smooth scraping.

2. **Dynamic Content:**
   Gathers data from JavaScript-rendered websites.

3. **Markdown or Structured data conversion:**
   Converts collected data into clean markdown or structured output, perfect for LLM processing or any other task.

For more details, refer to the [Scrape Endpoint Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/scrape).
