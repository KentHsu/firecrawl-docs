## Crawl with Firecrawl

Firecrawl thoroughly crawls websites, ensuring comprehensive data extraction while bypassing any web blocker mechanisms. Here's how it works:

1. **URL Analysis:**
   Begins with a specified URL, identifying links by crawling or utilizing the website's sitemap.

2. **Recursive Traversal:**
   Recursively follows each link to uncover all subpages.

3. **Content Scraping:**
   Gathers content from every visited page while handling any complexities like JavaScript rendering or rate limits.

4. **Result Compilation:**
   Converts collected data into clean markdown or structured output, perfect for LLM processing or any other task.

This method guarantees an exhaustive crawl and data collection from any starting URL.


## Crawling

### /crawl endpoint

Used to crawl a URL and all accessible subpages. This submits a crawl job and returns a job ID to check the status of the crawl.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v0/crawl \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://mendable.ai"
    }'
```

Returns a jobId

```json
{ "jobId": "1234-5678-9101" }
```

### Check Crawl Job

Used to check the status of a crawl job and get its result.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.firecrawl.dev/v0/crawl/status/1234-5678-9101 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "current": 22,
  "total": 22,
  "data": [
    {
      "content": "Raw Content ",
      "markdown": "# Markdown Content",
      "provider": "web-scraper",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Mendable | AI for CX and Sales",
        "description": "AI for CX and Sales",
        "language": null,
        "sourceURL": "https://www.mendable.ai/"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using Python SDK

### Installing Python SDK

```bash
pip install firecrawl-py
```

### Crawl a website

```python
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

crawl_result = app.crawl_url('mendable.ai', {'crawlerOptions': {'excludes': ['blog/*']}})

# Get the markdown
for result in crawl_result:
    print(result['markdown'])
```

### With JavaScript SDK

#### Installing JavaScript SDK

```bash
npm install @mendable/firecrawl-js
```

#### Crawl a website

```js
import FirecrawlApp from '@mendable/firecrawl-js';

// Initialize the FirecrawlApp with your API key
const app = new FirecrawlApp({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

// Crawl a website
const crawlResult = await app.crawlUrl('mendable.ai', { crawlerOptions: { excludes: ['blog/*'] } });

// Log the markdown
console.log(crawlResult.map(result => result.markdown));
```

The response will be similar to the one shown in the curl command above.
