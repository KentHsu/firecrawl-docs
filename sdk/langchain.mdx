## Installation

## Usage
You will need to get your own API key. See https://firecrawl.dev

from langchain_community.document_loaders import FireCrawlLoader

loader = FireCrawlLoader(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", url="https://firecrawl.dev", mode="crawl"
)

docs = loader.load()
```

### Modes
Scrape: Scrape single url and return the markdown.
Crawl: Crawl the url and all accessible sub pages and return the markdown for each one.

```python
loader = FireCrawlLoader(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    url="https://firecrawl.dev",
    mode="scrape",
)

data = loader.load()
```



### Crawler Options
You can also pass params to the loader. This is a dictionary of options to pass to the crawler. See the FireCrawl API documentation for more information.
