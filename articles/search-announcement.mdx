We are thrilled to announce the beta release of FireSearch, a search + extraction api. With /search endpoint, you give Firecrawl a query, it searches the web for the top results, scrape the top pages, and gives you clean markdown for each so you can feed directly to your LLM.


### Quick Start Guide

Here's how you can get started with FireSearch to fetch web content for your LLM:

Step 1: Crafting Your Search Request
To execute a search query and receive markdown-formatted content:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v0/search \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer fc-YOUR_API_KEY' \
-d '{
"query": "your_search_term",
"pageOptions": {
"fetchPageContent": true
}
}'
```
Replace `fc-YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key and `your_search_term` with the term you wish to search for.

#### Step 2: Handling the Response
The FireSearch API will return search results in markdown format, which you can then readily supply to your LLM for further processing or integration into your system.


```json
[
  {
    "title": "Example Page Title",
    "url": "https://www.example.com",
    "content": "# Page Heading\n\nContent of the page in markdown format..."
  },
  // Additional results
]
```
We look forward to seeing how FireSearch can power up your projects!

### Current Status:

FireSearch is currently in beta, and we are diligently working to refine and improve its capabilities.

Integration support for playgrounds, Python/TypeScript SDK, and @LangChainAI is on the horizon.
